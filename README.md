#### Executive summary


#### Rationale
During the entire course of the pandemic, one of the main problems that healthcare providers have faced is the shortage of medical resources and a proper plan to efficiently distribute them. In these tough times, being able to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of immense help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that, given a Covid-19 patient's current symptom, status, and medical history, will predict whether the patient is in high risk or not.
Why should anyone care about this question?

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?

#### Data Sources
The COVID19 dataset is taken from Kaggle and was provided by the Mexican government (link). This dataset contains an enormous number of anonymized patient-related information including pre-conditions. The raw dataset consists of 21 unique features and 1,048,576 unique patients. In the Boolean features, 1 means "yes" and 2 means "no". values as 97 and 99 are missing data.

Patients medical history, Covid test findings, any chronic diseases and other healthy habits can be used to determine if the patient is at high risk or not. 

#### Methodology
In this project, I have used various machine learning models like.
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree
* Random Forests
* Naive Bayes

What methods are you using to answer the question?

#### Results
* Old people are at high risk for COVID19
* People with Pneumonia are at high risk
* People with chronic disesases like diabetes, hypertension are also at the risk of Covid
* Pregnant women are at low risk of COVID19
